# restaurant-homepage

This project is a restaurant website aimed to create a welcoming atmosphere for visitors. The website boasts some outstanding features, including a welcoming home tab, a menu tab, and a tab with the restaurant's contact information. At the top of the page, there are buttons to easily switch between the three tabs.

I utilized the module blunder "Webpack" in the development of this website.
