# restaurant-homepage

This project is a restaurant website aimed to create a welcoming atmosphere for visitors. This website has a few outstanding features: 3 tabs; a welcoming home page, a menu page, and a page with the restaurant's contact information. There are buttons to switch between tabs at the top. 

I utilized the module blunder, Webpack in the development of this website.
